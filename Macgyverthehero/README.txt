Dear mappers,

nmo_southpole is a project I started a long time ago with the intent to make an objective map about survivors needing to escape the south pole station, an isolated and
repurposed FEMA base that was supposed to be one of the last safe places on earth from the zombie outbreak and where the final stages of a vaccine were about to be prepared.

Unfortunately due to my own procrastination and other commitments to life, plus new projects; I do not have time or motivation to continue with nmo_southpole anymore.
This is why am giving away all versions of nmo_southpole that I ever created so perhaps another mapper can continue and finish what I've started.

As my builds of nmo_southpole are now public domain, allowing mappers to continue my work or start anew, the only courtesy that I ask is that I am given credit for providing
my maps as foundation to your own version of nmo_southpole.

I do thank the NMRiH community with giving positive feedback and impressions from when I was more actively working on nmo_southpole, however I wish to apologize for not
being able to deliver a final version or a more fully laid out foundation for how the map progresses.


Thank you, everyone.
