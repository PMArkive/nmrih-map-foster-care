> Hey guys, mapper of nmo_southpole here. I'm giving away all versions of nmo_southpole I ever worked on as I can't work on them anymore. If anyone would like to continue them you can download them here. Please see the enclosed README file for details.

> I've been meaning to release all of my vmfs and give it to whoever wants them for any possible purpose. I wanna focus on learning Blender (modelling) and remaking shelter perhaps / continuing the series. Any opinions or ideas about this are welcome. I don't feel like i have much more interest in using the Source Engine. But i do feel like certain maps can be better (like Parish, Abandonment and Catacombs). As i'm not able to improve them due to personal problems / mental health, i've decided to put them out for people to learn on or to improve them. I feel like it's time to move forward and with Source it's definitely not possible
